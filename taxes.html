    <h2>Taxes — Detailed Guide</h2>
    <p>Taxes fund public services. This page explores common tax types, when they apply, and provides examples to help you understand how they work in practice.</p>

    <h3>Income Tax</h3>
    <p>Collected on earnings. Progressive systems tax higher income at higher rates. Example: if brackets are 10%, 20%, a portion of income pays each rate.</p>

    <h3>Payroll Tax</h3>
    <p>Used to fund social programs and often withheld from paychecks (e.g., social security, medicare). Employers usually share contributions.</p>

    <h3>Sales Tax / VAT</h3>
    <p>Collected when consumers purchase goods or services. VAT is charged at each production stage but ultimately borne by consumer.</p>

    <h3>Property Tax</h3>
    <p>Based on assessed value of real estate—commonly funds local services like schools.</p>

    <h3>Corporate Tax</h3>
    <p>Applied to company profits; affects business decisions and investment.</p>
