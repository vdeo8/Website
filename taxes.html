    <h2>Taxes — Overview</h2>
    <p>Taxes fund public services and are collected at local, regional, and national levels. Here are common tax types and when they apply.</p>

    <h3>Income Tax</h3>
    <p>Collected on individual or corporate earnings. Many countries use progressive rates (higher income, higher rate). Used to fund general government services.</p>

    <h3>Payroll Tax</h3>
    <p>Withheld from wages to fund specific programs (e.g., social security, healthcare). Employers often contribute as well.</p>

    <h3>Sales Tax / VAT</h3>
    <p>Applied to the sale of goods and services. Sales tax is common in the US; VAT (value-added tax) is common in many other countries. Usually paid by consumers at purchase.</p>

    <h3>Property Tax</h3>
    <p>Levied on real estate based on assessed value. Typically used to fund local services like schools and roads.</p>

    <h3>Corporate Tax</h3>
    <p>Tax on company profits. Rates and rules vary widely by country and can affect investment and location decisions.</p>

    <h3>When are they used?</h3>
    <p>Different taxes fund different things: payroll taxes for social programs, property taxes for local services, income/corporate taxes for broader government spending, and sales taxes for consumption-based revenue.</p>
