    <h2>Banking — Basics</h2>
    <p>Banking is a set of services that help people and businesses manage money. Below are the most common topics beginners should know.</p>

    <h3>Accounts</h3>
    <p>Checking accounts: for daily transactions, often with a debit card. Savings accounts: designed to hold money and earn interest. Certificates of Deposit (CDs): time-locked deposits with higher interest.</p>

    <h3>Interest</h3>
    <p>Interest is how banks pay you for keeping money (APY) or charge you for borrowing (APR). Compound interest grows savings faster than simple interest.</p>

    <h3>Loans &amp; Credit</h3>
    <p>Banks provide loans (personal, auto, mortgage) and credit products (credit cards). Loans have interest rates and repayment schedules. Your credit score affects loan terms.</p>

    <h3>Safety &amp; Insurance</h3>
    <p>In many countries, deposits are insured up to a limit (e.g., FDIC in the US). Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication for online banking.</p>

    <p>Practice challenges (matching and quiz) are available on the <a href="challenges.html">Challenges</a> page.</p>
