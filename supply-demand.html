    <h2>Supply & Demand — Basics</h2>
    <p>Supply and demand determine prices and quantities in markets. The intersection of the supply and demand curves is the market equilibrium.</p>

    <h3>Demand</h3>
    <p>Demand shows how much consumers want at each price. Generally, as price falls, quantity demanded rises (downward slope).</p>

    <h3>Supply</h3>
    <p>Supply shows how much producers will sell at each price. Generally, as price rises, quantity supplied rises (upward slope).</p>

    <h3>Equilibrium</h3>
    <p>Where supply and demand meet — that price clears the market (quantity supplied = quantity demanded).</p>

    <h3>Shifts vs movements</h3>
    <p>A change in price causes movement along a curve. A change in a non-price factor (income, tastes, input costs, technology) shifts the entire curve.</p>

    <h3>Elasticity</h3>
    <p>Elasticity measures how responsive quantity demanded or supplied is to price changes. High elasticity means quantity changes a lot with price.</p>
