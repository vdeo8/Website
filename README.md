# Basic Economics — Informational Website

This is a small informational website that introduces basic economics topics: Banking, Taxes, and Supply & Demand. The site uses a blue & white color theme and is intentionally simple and accessible.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page with three topic sections and a hero.
- `styles.css` — a compact stylesheet implementing the blue-and-white look.

How to use locally:
1. Save `index.html` and `styles.css` into the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use `open`/`xdg-open`).
3. To make changes, edit the files with your preferred editor and reload the page.

Next steps you might want:
- Add images or icons for each section.
- Expand each section with more examples, diagrams, or links to external resources.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages or any static hosting to share the site publicly.

If you'd like, I can:
- Prepare these files in your repository and commit them for you (I can walk you through authorizing that).
- Add more sections or a printable PDF summary.
- Convert this into a small static site generator structure (e.g., Jekyll or plain templating).

Tell me how you'd like to proceed.
