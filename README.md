# Learn Finance (demo)

This repository contains a small static educational website that explains basic financial topics. It now includes separate pages for:

- Banking (banking.html) — accounts, interest, loans, and safety tips.
- Taxes (taxes.html) — common tax types and when they apply.
- Supply & Demand (supply-demand.html) — core microeconomics concepts.

Preview the branch using a raw file hosting service (example):

Notes:
- This is a demo and educational site only. Not professional financial or tax advice.
- If you'd like a live GitHub Pages URL, enable Pages in the repository settings and choose the "banking-site" branch.
